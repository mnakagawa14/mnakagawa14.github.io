When first approaching JavaScript, I was first struck by its seeming similarity to Java. 
Java is my first and primary programming language, so at surface level, some of the syntax seemed familiar compared to other languages like Python.
However, I quickly realized how different of a language JavaScript truly is. It felt wrong not having to declare variable types as Java had accustomed me to.

Even odder was the decision to make all variables declared without 'var', 'let', or 'const' global variables by default.
I questioned why I would want to use a language in which a forgotten keyword could lead to hours of headaches and bug fixing.
Global variables seemed to serve a similar function to pointers in C, but defining and declaring pointers in C was a much more deliberate syntax.

Although JavaScript's implementation of global variables continues to confuse me, I found that I quite liked some of its other basic design decisions.
One that particularly stood out was the simplicity of working with JSON data. I found parsing JSONs in JavaScript so much quicker than in Java.
There was no need to import any libraries nor was there a necessity to explicitly type the data. 
I can definitely see why the ability to quickly update and parse human-readable JSON is a boon for developers.

As I continued to work with JavaScript, I began to appreciate the flexibility that its weak typing of variables allows.
It greatly speeds up the process of writing simple programs by reducing the need to explicitly cast data types.
Although Iâ€™m still weary of errors and unintentional behavior in more complex code, JavaScript has allowed me to focus more on accomplishing the goal and less on the minutiae of how to get there.
I am very excited to have JavaScript in my programming toolbox. My main concern now is will I be able to efficiently switch between JavaScript and other more restrictive languages.
I could see myself becoming accustomed to the looser approach of JavaScript and becoming slower with other languages.

Only time will tell.
