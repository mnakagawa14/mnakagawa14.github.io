When first approaching JavaScript, I was first struck by its fluidity. The first programming language I learned was Java, so some of the syntax seemed familiar.

However, I quickly realized how different of a language JavaScript truly is. It felt wrong not having to declare variable types as Java had accustomed me to.

Even odder was the decision to make all variables declared without 'var', 'let', or 'const' global variables by default.

I questioned why I would want to use a language in which a forgotten keyword could lead to hours of headaches and bug fixing.

Global variables seemed to serve a similar function to pointers in C, but defining and declaring pointers in C was a much more deliberate syntax.

Although JavaScript's implementation of global variables continues to confuse me, I found that I quite liked some of its other basic design decisions.

One that particularly stood out was the simplicity of working with JSON data. I found parsing JSONs in JavaScript so much quicker than in Java.

There was no need to import any libraries nor was there a neccessity to explicitly type the data. I can definitly see why the ability to quickly

update and parse human-readable JSON is a boon for developers.
