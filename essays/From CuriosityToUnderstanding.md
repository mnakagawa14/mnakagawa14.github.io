From Curiosity to Understanding: The Goal of Smart Questions

Communication is one of the most important skills to have in any career. It can be the difference between an efficient development process and hours of troubleshooting and stalled progress. There are many resources available on the web that allow developers to tap into each other's expertise, however StackOverflow is perhaps the most prominent.

StackOverflow, a question and answer website for programmers, has developed quite a reputation for itself. On the one hand, it hosts tens of millions of questions and answers as well as a strong community of experienced developers providing a deep resource to draw upon. On the other hand, it has the reputation of not tolerating dumb, vague, or lazy questions which can result in downvoting and possible question removal.

In his essay [â€œHow To Ask Questions The Smart Way''](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html), Eric Steven Raymond outlines some basic guidelines on how to get the most out of online resources. He makes several seemingly simple yet meaningful observations about what type of questions produces the best outcomes. He notes that all other resources should be utilized before it is posed to one's peers. 

This is for several reasons. Perhaps most importantly it could lead to finding a solution either through documentation, experimentation, or an answer to a previously posted question. Even if no exact solution can be found, research allows you to refine your understanding of the issue and to more precisely pose your question. It also shows a willingness to work and learn, which is much more likely to gain you respect.
