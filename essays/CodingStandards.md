Coding standards are an often overlooked part of software development. For newcomers to programming, they might seem like a tedious hindrance, impeding progress. Seasoned developers, on the other hand, might dismiss them as trivial, hardly worth their attention. However, I believe that coding standards, although lacking in glamor, are a vital part of best practices in software development.

Enforcing coding standards can be viewed as analogous to properly formatting an essay. An essay, even if grammatically correct and packed with interesting information, can be an ordeal to read if it lacks proper formatting. Superfluous whitespaces, lack of paragraphs, and run-on sentences make a disconnected and unpleasant reading experience. Similarly, poorly formatted code, while it may function properly, is challenging to understand, develop, and maintain. Coding standards act as the formatters, identifying potential bugs, and simplifying code.

Analysis tools like ESLint are a convenient way to catch and fix violations of coding standards. They conveniently pinpoint the rule being violated and, in many instances, offer automatic fixes. In my experience, this greatly helps to instill good coding form. In all honesty, without automatic checks, I’d find it daunting to manually check my code against a multitude of rules. Learning all the standards at once would be quite the undertaking on its own. Then adding manual proofreading for both style and functionality would be overwhelming for a new software developer like myself.

Although it is discouraging to witness red squiggles materialize beneath freshly written code, I’ve come to value it as a learning experience. Over time, I have found that I have passively learned many of the style rules, having to make far fewer corrections now than in the beginning. Striving for that no errors green checkmark has made me a better software developer.
