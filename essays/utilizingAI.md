## I. Introduction
The advent of generative AI tools, exemplified by ChatGPT, Bard, and Co-Pilot, has led to both educators and students being forced to reevaluate their approach to education. These tools, with their support of natural language processing and user-friendly interfaces, have made the technology accessible. 

## II. Use of AI in ICS 314

#### Experience Workouts of the Day (WOD)
I used AI with Experience WODs rather sparingly. As these WODs were graded solely based on being attempted, there was no grade based incentive to utilize it. Typically, when faced with a problem I would consult the accompanying video demonstrating the solution. However, on the occasions where I did use ChatGPT, I mostly asked it questions about syntax. An example of this is in E13, when implementing an order interface in JavaScript, I asked how to print a float to 2 decimals.

#### In-class Practice WODs
My use of AI with in-class practice WODs was similar to experience WODs, mainly asking about syntax. An example of this was when building Murphy’s website mockup with bootstrap, I asked about how to add a linebreak.

#### In-class WODs
I utilized ChatGPT much more with in-class WODs due to the fact they were graded and timed. I would often ask it to error check the code and implement solutions to the errors if I was running out of time. I found that it was generally good at error checking, but struggled when in more complex multi-file environments like web development. An example of this was in the WOD using React to implement a page mockup. I was running out of time and asked ChatGPT how to change the text color of specific elements using the .css file. The solution it gave did not work and I ended up having to devise a solution myself.

#### Essays
I didn’t use ChatGPT for any of the essays as I didn’t feel the need to.

#### Final Project
I haven’t used AI with my final project for the course. This is due to the fact that we have built similar websites with a Meteor template in Experience WODs. I have been referring to that material for guidance.

#### Learning Concepts
I have used AI extensively to help me learn new concepts and get a refresher on old ones. I have found this quite helpful and the information provided by ChatGPT has proved accurate so far. An example of this is when I used ChatGPT to get a refresher on version control using GitHub.

#### Answering a Question in Class or in Discord
I have never used AI to answer a question in class or in Discord. It would feel rather disingenuous to use AI to answer someone else’s questions.

#### Asking or Answering a Smart-Question
I have never used AI for this purpose. I could see the use of AI to gather background information to pose a smart-question, but it would have to be a rather niche question. In my experience ChatGPT has been able to answer most questions. I wouldn’t use AI to answer a question as if I didn’t know the answer, there is no way for me to check the AI’s answer without implementing its solution.

#### Coding Example
I’ve never used AI to get general coding examples. I’ve always found asking specific questions more useful.

#### Explaining Code
I’ve also never used AI to explain code. Generally I’ve been able to follow along with WOD videos or documentation. In instances where I have been confused, like with certain areas of a template Meteor implementation, I’ve just traced the code until I understood it. I feel like that is the best way to learn.

#### Writing Code
I have never used AI to write code wholesale, but I have used ChatGPT to edit my code and find solutions to errors as outlined in the in-class WODs section above.

#### Documenting Code
I have never used AI to document code. It never really crossed my mind. I could see it being useful, but I would still have to double check it.

#### Quality Assurance
I have used AI to check code as outlined in the in-class WODs section above.

#### Other Uses
I’ve used AI to generate example data to add to a Mongo database. The data generated by ChatGPT worked well and it saved me time.

## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding
Since I was introduced to ChatGPT in 2022, I have struggled with deciding how much to utilize AI in my educational journey. I found it is far more convenient to ask ChatGPT to explain a concept than it is to find a good article online or to attend a professor’s office hours. This undoubtedly improved my learning process, as it lowered the barrier to obtaining knowledge. However, it also presented the temptation to delegate coding to the AI. I found that ChatGPT was quite good at writing simple code, but it degraded the learning process. I have adopted a nuanced approach, leveraging ChatGPT primarily as an error checker when coding. This entails letting it suggest improvements or identify errors as opposed to writing the whole code outright.
