## I. Introduction
The advent of generative AI tools, exemplified by ChatGPT, Bard, and Co-Pilot, has led to both educators and students being forced to reevaluate their approach to education. These tools, with their support of natural language processing and user-friendly interfaces, have made the technology accessible. 

## II. Use of AI in ICS 314

### Experience Workouts of the Day (WOD)
I used AI with Experience WODs rather sparingly. As these WODs were graded solely based on being attempted, there was no grade based incentive to utilize it. Typically, when faced with a problem I would consult the accompanying video demonstrating the solution. However, on the occasions where I did use ChatGPT, I mostly asked it questions about syntax. An example of this is in E13, when implementing an order interface in JavaScript, I asked how to print a float to 2 decimals.

### In-class Practice WODs
My use of AI with in-class practice WODs was similar to experience WODs, mainly asking about syntax. An example of this was when building Murphy’s website mockup with bootstrap, I asked about how to add a linebreak.

### In-class WODs
I utilized ChatGPT much more with in-class WODs due to the fact they were graded and timed. I would often ask it to error check the code and implement solutions to the errors if I was running out of time. I found that it was generally good at error checking, but struggled when in more complex multi-file environments like web development. An example of this was in the WOD using React to implement a page mockup. I was running out of time and asked ChatGPT how to change the text color of specific elements using the .css file. The solution it gave did not work and I ended up having to devise a solution myself.

### Essays
I didn’t use ChatGPT for any of the essays as I didn’t feel the need to.

### Final Project
I haven’t used AI with my final project for the course. This is due to the fact that we have built similar websites with a Meteor template in Experience WODs. I have been referring to that material for guidance.

### Learning Concepts


## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding
Since I was introduced to ChatGPT in 2022, I have struggled with deciding how much to utilize AI in my educational journey. I found it is far more convenient to ask ChatGPT to explain a concept than it is to find a good article online or to attend a professor’s office hours. This undoubtedly improved my learning process, as it lowered the barrier to obtaining knowledge. However, it also presented the temptation to delegate coding to the AI. I found that ChatGPT was quite good at writing simple code, but it degraded the learning process. I have adopted a nuanced approach, leveraging ChatGPT primarily as an error checker when coding. This entails letting it suggest improvements or identify errors as opposed to writing the whole code outright.
