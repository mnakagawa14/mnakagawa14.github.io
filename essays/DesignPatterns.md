Exploring any subject in depth unveils recurring challenges that can be addressed with common patterns. Take cooking for instance, encountering the need to flavor and thicken a sauce is a familiar scenario. Delving into culinary literature and practices reveals a consistent solution pattern. In Western cooking, sauces often find their thickness through a flour roux and are enriched with the aromatic trio of mirepoix (carrots, onion, and celery), complemented by some form of stock. These culinary strategies mirror the concept of design patterns or best practices in software development. These patterns provide valuable templates that offer a reliable structure for problem-solving. They are not rigidly specific, instead offering a flexible framework that can be applied widely, streamlining the process of finding effective solutions.
